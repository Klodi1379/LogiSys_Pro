A comprehensive Django-based logistics and supply chain management system with route optimization, inventory management, and real-time tracking capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Accounts**: User management with role-based access control
- **Inventory**: Product catalog, suppliers, and stock management  
- **Warehousing**: Multi-warehouse operations with location tracking
- **Orders**: Complete order lifecycle management
- **Transport**: Vehicle fleet, driver management, and route optimization
- **Analytics**: Performance metrics and demand forecasting

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django 4.2 + Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Background Tasks**: Celery
- **Real-time**: Django Channels (WebSockets)
- **Optimization**: Google OR-Tools
- **Analytics**: Pandas, Scikit-learn

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Run the setup script
setup_project.bat

# Activate virtual environment
venv\\Scripts\\activate

# Create models
python setup_models.py
python setup_more_models.py

# Setup admin interfaces  
python setup_admin.py
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Create migrations
python manage.py makemigrations accounts inventory warehousing orders transport

# Apply migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
# Start Redis (required for Celery and Channels)
# Download from: https://redis.io/download

# Start Celery worker (in separate terminal)
celery -A logistic_system worker -l info

# Start Celery Beat scheduler (in separate terminal)  
celery -A logistic_system beat -l info

# Start Django development server
python manage.py runserver
```

### 4. Access the System

redis-server
```

**2. Celery Worker Not Starting**
```bash
# Check Redis connectivity
celery -A logistic_system inspect ping
```

**3. Migration Errors**
```bash
# Reset migrations (development only)

# Get access token
POST /api/auth/login/
{
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "your-password"  
}

# Use in headers
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
```

### Core Endpoints
- `GET /api/products/` - Product catalog
- `POST /api/orders/` - Create order
- `GET /api/shipments/` - Track shipments
- `GET /api/analytics/dashboard/` - Dashboard metrics
